# PROJECT REPORT

## 1. Project Title: 
Election Voting Management System

## 2. Abstract:
The Election Voting Management System is a CLI based application designed to manage and streamline the process of conducting elections. It aims to automate the traditional manual process, reducing the chances of errors and increasing the efficiency of the overall voting process. The system can handle various tasks such as voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting, ensuring a transparent and secure election process.

## 3. Problem Statement:
In traditional election processes, there are numerous challenges such as manual voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting. These processes are time-consuming, prone to human error, and lack transparency, which can lead to disputes over election results. The need for a secure, efficient, and transparent system for managing elections is evident. The Simple Election Voting Management System aims to address these issues by automating these processes, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in elections.

## 4. Objective:
The objective of the Election Voting Management System is to automate and streamline the election process. 

## 5. Methodology: 
The methodology for developing the Election Voting Management System involves the following steps:

- **Requirement Analysis:** Identify and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. This includes understanding the election process, voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting procedures.

- **System Design:** Design the system architecture and database schema. This includes designing the user interface for voter registration and vote casting, and the algorithm for vote counting.

- **Implementation:** Write the code for the system in C programming language. This includes coding the user interface, database interactions, and the vote counting algorithm.

- **Testing:** Test the system to ensure it meets all the functional and non-functional requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

- **Deployment:** Deploy the system for use in an election. This includes setting up the system on the required hardware and providing training to the users.

- **Maintenance:** Monitor the system during the election to ensure it operates without any issues. This includes troubleshooting any issues that arise and making necessary updates to the system.
